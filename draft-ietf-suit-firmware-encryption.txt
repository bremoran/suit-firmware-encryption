Abstract

   This document specifies techniques for encrypting software, firmware
   and personalization data by utilizing the IETF SUIT manifest.  Key
   agreement is provided by ephemeral-static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH)
   and AES Key Wrap (AES-KW).  ES-DH uses public key cryptography while
   AES-KW uses a pre-shared key-encryption key.  Encryption of the
   plaintext is accomplished with conventional symmetric key
   cryptography.

1.  Introduction

   Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the
   need for a reliable and secure firmware update mechanism that is also
   suitable for constrained devices.  To protect firmware images the
   SUIT manifest format was developed [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].  The
   SUIT manifest provides a bundle of metadata about the firmware for an
   IoT device, where to find the firmware image, and the devices to
   which it applies.

   The SUIT information model [RFC9124] details the information that has
   to be offered by the SUIT manifest format.  In addition to offering
   protection against modification, which is provided by a digital
   signature or a message authentication code, the firmware image may
   also be afforded confidentiality using encryption.

   Encryption prevents third parties, including attackers, from gaining
   access to the firmware binary.  Hackers typically need intimate
   knowledge of the target firmware to mount their attacks.  For
   example, return-oriented programming (ROP) [ROP] requires access to
   the binary and encryption makes it much more difficult to write
   exploits.

   The SUIT manifest provides the data needed for authorized recipients
   of the firmware image to decrypt it.  The firmware image is encrypted
   using a symmetric key.

   A symmetric key can be established using a variety of mechanisms;
   this document defines two approaches for use with the IETF SUIT
   manifest, namely:

   *  Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH), and

   *  AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) using a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK).

   OPEN ISSUE: Should KEM algorithms also be supported?

   These choices reduce the number of possible key establishment options
   and thereby help increase interoperability between different SUIT
   manifest parser implementations.

   While the original motivating use case of this document was firmware
   encryption, SUIT manifests may require payloads other than firmware
   images to experience confidentiality protection, such as

   *  software packages,

   *  personalization data,

   *  configuration data, and

   *  machine learning models.

   Hence, the term payload is used to generically refer to those objects
   that may be subject to encryption.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes familiarity with the IETF SUIT manifest
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest], the SUIT information model [RFC9124] and
   the SUIT architecture [RFC9019].

   The terms sender and recipient have the following meaning:

   *  Sender: Role of the entity that sends an encrypted payload.

   *  Recipient: Role of the entity that receives an encrypted payload.

   Additionally, the following abbreviations are used in this document:

   *  Key Wrap (KW), defined in [RFC3394] (for use with AES)

   *  Key-Encryption Key (KEK) [RFC3394]

   *  Content-Encryption Key (CEK) [RFC5652]

   *  Ephemeral-Static (ES) Diffie-Hellman (DH) [RFC9052]

3.  Architecture

   [RFC9019] describes the architecture for distributing payloads and
   manifests from an author to devices.  It does, however, not detail
   the use of payload encryption.

   This document enhances this architecture to support encryption.  The
   author and the distribution system are logical roles.  In some
   deployments these roles are separated in different physical entities
   and in others they are co-located.

   Figure 1 shows the distribution system, which represents the firmware
   server and the device management infrastructure.  The distribution
   system is aware of the individual devices to which a payload has to
   be delivered.  The author is typically unaware which devices need to
   receive these payloads.

   To apply encryption the sender needs to know the recipient.  For AES-
   KW the KEK needs to be known and, in case of ES-DH, the sender needs
   to be in possession of the public key of the recipient.  The DH
   public key and parameters may be in the recipient's X.509 certificate
   [RFC5280].

   If the author delegates the task of identifying the recipients of the
   payloads to the distribution system, it needs to trust it with the
   appropriate protection of the plaintext firmware image before
   encryption is performed.

   To offer confidentiality protection two deployment variants need to
   be supported:

   *  The author, as the sender, transmits the encrypted payload to a
      single device, or to multiple devices.  The device(s) perform
      decryption and act as recipients.

   *  The author treats the distribution system as the initial
      recipient.  Then, the distribution system decrypts and re-encrypts
      the payload for consumption by the device (or the devices).
      Delegating the task of re-encrypting the payload to the
      distribution system offers flexiblity when the number of devices
      that need to receive encrypted payloads changes dynamically or
      when updates to KEKs or recipient public keys are necessary.  As a
      downside, the author needs to trust the distribution system with
      performing the re-encryption of the payload.

   For both variants the key distribution data, which is embedded inside
   the COSE_Encrypt structure, is included in the SUIT manifest.

4.  New Extensions

   This specification introduces two extensions to the SUIT_Parameters
   structure.

   *  A SUIT encryption info parameter (called suit-parameter-
      encryption-info), see Figure 2, which contains key distribution
      information.  It is carried within the suit-directive-override-
      parameters or the suit-directive-set-parameters structure.  The
      content of the SUIT_Encryption_Info structure is explained in
      Section 6.1 (for AES-KW) and Section 6.2 (for ECDH-ES).  An
      implementation claiming conformance with this specification must
      implement support for this parameter.  A device may, however,
      support only one of the available key distribution techniques.

   *  A CEK verification parameter (called suit-parameter-cek-
      verification), see Figure 2, is utilized in environments where
      battery exhaustion attacks are a concern.  Details about the CEK
      verification can be found in Section 7.  This parameter is
      optional to implement and use.

   SUIT_Parameters //= (suit-parameter-encryption-info
       => bstr .cbor SUIT_Encryption_Info)
   SUIT_Parameters //= (suit-parameter-cek-verification => bstr)

   suit-parameter-encryption-info   = [TBD1: Proposed 19]
   suit-parameter-cek-verification  = [TBD2: Proposed 20]

   *  Directive Write (suit-directive-write) to decrypt the content
      specified by suit-parameter-content with suit-parameter-
      encryption-info.

   *  Directive Copy (suit-directive-copy) to decrypt the content of the
      component specified by suit-parameter-source-component with suit-
      parameter-encryption-info.

6.  Content Key Distribution Methods

   The sub-sections below describe two content key distribution
   mechanisms, namely AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) and Ephemeral-Static Diffie-
   Hellman (ES-DH).  Other mechanisms are supported by COSE and may be
   supported via enhancements to this specification.

   When an encrypted firmware image is sent to multiple recipients,
   there are different deployment options.  To explain these options we
   use the following notation:

   *  KEK(R1,S) refers to a KEK shared between recipient R1 and the
      sender S.  The KEK, as a concept, is used by AES Key Wrap.

   *  CEK(R1,S) refers to a CEK shared between R1 and S.

   *  CEK(_,S) or KEK(_,S) are used when a single CEK or a single KEK is
      shared with all authorized recipients by a given sender S in a
      certain context.

   *  ENC(plaintext, k) refers to the encryption of plaintext with a key
      k.

   *  KEK_i or CEK_i refers to the i-th instance of the KEK or CEK,
      respectively.

6.1.  Content Key Distribution with AES Key Wrap

6.1.1.  Introduction

   The AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) algorithm is described in RFC 3394
   [RFC3394], and can be used to encrypt a randomly generated content-
   encryption key (CEK) with a pre-shared key-encryption key (KEK).  The
   COSE conventions for using AES-KW are specified in Section 8.5.2 of
   [RFC9052] and in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC9053].  The encrypted CEK is
   carried in the COSE_recipient structure alongside the information
   needed for AES-KW.  The COSE_recipient structure, which is a
   substructure of the COSE_Encrypt structure, contains the CEK
   encrypted by the KEK.

   The COSE_Encrypt structure conveys information for encrypting the
   payload, which includes information like the algorithm and the IV,
   even though the payload is not embedded in the
   COSE_Encrypt.ciphertext itself since it conveyed as detached content.

6.1.2.  Deployment Options

   There are three deployment options for use with AES Key Wrap for
   payload encryption:

   *  If all authorized recipients have access to the KEK, a single
      COSE_recipient structure contains the encrypted CEK.  The sender
      executes the following steps:

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests        April 2023


         Fetch KEK(*,S)
         Generate CEK
         ENC(CEK,KEK)
         ENC(payload,CEK)

   *  If recipients have different KEKs, then multiple COSE_recipient
      structures are included but only a single CEK is used.  Each
      COSE_recipient structure contains the CEK encrypted with the KEKs
      appropriate for a given recipient.  The benefit of this approach
      is that the payload is encrypted only once with a CEK while there
      is no sharing of the KEK across recipients.  Hence, authorized
      recipients still use their individual KEK to decrypt the CEK and
      to subsequently obtain the plaintext.  The steps taken by the
      sender are:

         Generate CEK
         for i=1 to n {
            Fetch KEK_i(Ri, S)
            ENC(CEK, KEK_i)
         }
         ENC(payload,CEK)

   *  The third option is to use different CEKs encrypted with KEKs of
      authorized recipients.  Assume there are n recipients with their
      unique KEKs - KEK_1(R1, S),..., KEK_n(Rn, S).  The sender needs to
      make the following steps:

         for i=1 to n {
            Fetch KEK_i(Ri, S)
            Generate CEK_i
            ENC(CEK_i, KEK_i)
            ENC(payload,CEK_i)
         }

   This approach is appropriate when no benefits can be gained from
   encrypting and transmitting payloads only once.

6.1.3.  CDDL

   The CDDL for the COSE_Encrypt_Tagged structure is shown in Figure 5.

   Note that the AES-KW algorithm, as defined in Section 2.2.3.1 of
   [RFC3394], does not have public parameters that vary on a per-
   invocation basis.  Hence, the protected parameter in the
   COSE_recipient structure is a byte string of zero length.

   The COSE specification requires a consistent byte stream for the
   authenticated data structure to be created.  This structure is
   replaced in Figure 6.

   This Enc_structure needs to be populated as follows:

   The protected field in the Enc_structure from Figure 6 refers to the

   is important to note that there are two protected fields shown in

   *  a second one in the COSE_recipient structure.

   The value of the external_aad MUST be set to a null value (major type
   7, value 22).

6.2.  Content Key Distribution with Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman

6.2.1.  Introduction

   Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman (ES-DH) is a scheme that provides
   public key encryption given a recipient's public key.  There are
   multiple variants of this scheme; this document re-uses the variant
   specified in Section 8.5.5 of [RFC9052].

   The following three layer structure is used:

   *  Layer 0: Has a content encrypted with the CEK.  The content may be
      detached.

   *  Layer 1: Uses the AES Key Wrap algorithm to encrypt a randomly
      generated CEK with the KEK derived by layer 2.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests        April 2023


   *  Layer 2: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the KEK for
      layer 1.

   As a result, the three layers combine ECDH-ES with AES-KW.  An
   example is given in Appendix B of RFC 9052 and in Figure 9.

6.2.2.  Deployment Options

   There are two deployment options with this approach.  We assume that
   recipients are always configured with a device-unique public /
   private key pair.

   *  A sender wants to transmit a payload to multiple recipients.  All
      recipients shall receive the same encrypted payload, i.e. the same
      CEK is used.  One COSE_recipient structure per recipient is used
      and it contains the CEK encrypted with the KEK.  To generate the
      KEK each COSE_recipient structure contains a COSE_recipient_inner
      structure to carry the sender's emphemeral key and an identifier
      for the recipients public key.

   The steps taken by the sender are:

         Generate CEK
         for i=1 to n {
            Generate KEK_i(Ri, S) using ES-DH
            ENC(CEK, KEK_i)
         }
         ENC(payload,CEK)

   *  The alternative is to encrypt a payload with a different CEK for
      each recipient.  Assume there are KEK_1(R1, S),..., KEK_n(Rn, S)
      have been generated for the different recipients using ES-DH.  The
      following steps needs to be made by the sender:

         for i=1 to n {
            Generate KEK_i(Ri, S) using ES-DH
            Generate CEK_i
            ENC(CEK_i, KEK_i)
            ENC(payload,CEK_i)
         }

   This results in n-manifests.  This approach is useful when payloads
   contain information unique to a device.  The encryption operation
   effectively becomes ENC(payload_i,CEK_i).

7.  CEK Verification

   While the SUIT manifest is integrity protected and authenticated, the
   SUIT envelope is not protected cryptographically.  Hence, an
   adversary located along the communication path between the sender and
   the recipient could modify the COSE_Encrypt structure (assuming that
   no other communication security mechanism is in use).

   For example, if the attacker alters the key distribution data then a
   recipient will decrypt the firmware image with an incorrect key.
   This will lead to expending energy and flash cycles until the failure
   is detected.

   To mitigate this attack, a new parameter, called suit-cek-
   verification, is added to the manifest.  The suit-cek-verification
   parameter is optional to implement and optional to use.  When used,
   it reduces the risk of a battery exhaustion attack against the IoT
   device.

   Since the manifest is protected by a digital signature or a MAC, an
   adversary cannot successfully modify this value.  This parameter
   allows the recipient to verify whether the CEK has successfully been
   derived.

   The suit-cek-verification parameter contains a byte string resulting
   from the encryption of 8 bytes of 0xA5 using the CEK with a nonce of
   all zeros and empty additional data using the cipher algorithm and
   mode also used to encrypt the plaintext.  The same nonce used for CEK
   verification MUST NOT be used to encrypt plaintext with the same CEK.

8.  Firmware Updates on IoT Devices with Flash Memory.

   Flash memory on microcontrollers is a type of non-volatile memory
   that erases data in units called blocks, pages or sectors and re-
   writes data at byte level (often 4-bytes).  Flash memory is
   furthermore segmented into different memory regions, which store the
   bootloader, different versions of firmware images (in so-called
   slots), and configuration data.  Figure 10 shows an example layout of
   a microcontroller flash area.  The primary slot contains the firmware
   image to be executed by the bootloader, which is a common deployment
   on devices that do not offer the concept of position independent
   code.

   When the encrypted firmware image has been transferred to the device,
   it will typically be stored in a staging area, in the secondary slot
   in our example.





Tschofenig, et al.       Expires 15 October 2023               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests        April 2023


   At the next boot, the bootloader will recognize a new firmware image
   in the secondary slot and will start decrypting the downloaded image
   sector-by-sector and will swap it with the image found in the primary
   slot.

   The swap should only take place after the signature on the plaintext
   is verified.  Note that the plaintext firmware image is available in
   the primary slot only after the swap has been completed, unless
   "dummy decrypt" is used to compute the hash over the plaintext prior
   to executing the decrypt operation during a swap.  Dummy decryption
   here refers to the decryption of the firmware image found in the
   secondary slot sector-by-sector and computing a rolling hash over the
   resulting plaintext firmware image (also sector-by-sector) without
   performing the swap operation.  While there are performance
   optimizations possible, such as conveying hashes for each sector in
   the manifest rather than a hash of the entire firmware image, such
   optimizations are not described in this specification.

   This approach of swapping the newly downloaded image with the
   previously valid image is often referred as A/B approach.  A/B refers
   to the two slots involved.  Two slots are used to allow the update to
   be reversed in case the newly obtained firmware image fails to boot.
   This approach adds robustness to the firmware update procedure.

   Since the image in primary slot is available in cleartext it may need
   to re-encrypted it before copying it to the secondary slot.  This may
   be necessary when the secondary slot has different access permissions
   or when the staging area is located in an off-chip flash memory and
   therefore more vulnerable to physical attacks.  Note that this
   description assumes that the processor does not execute encrypted
   memory (i.e. using on-the-fly decryption in hardware).

   The ability to restart an interrupted firmware update is often a
   requirement for low-end IoT devices.  To fulfill this requirement it
   is necessary to chunk a firmware image into sectors and to encrypt
   each sector individually using a cipher that does not increase the
   size of the resulting ciphertext (i.e., by not adding an
   authentication tag after each encrypted block).

   When an update gets aborted while the bootloader is decrypting the
   newly obtained image and swapping the sectors, the bootloader can
   restart where it left off.  This technique offers robustness and
   better performance.

   For this purpose ciphers without integrity protection are used to
   encrypt the firmware image.  Integrity protection for the firmware
   image must, however, be provided and the suit-parameter-image-digest,
   defined in Section 8.4.8.6 of [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest], MUST be used.

   [I-D.ietf-cose-aes-ctr-and-cbc] registers AES Counter mode (AES-CTR)
   and AES Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) ciphers that do not offer
   integrity protection.  These ciphers are useful for the use cases
   that require firmware encryption on IoT devices.  For many other use
   cases where software packages, configuration information or
   personalization data needs to be encrypted, the use of Authenticated
   Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) ciphers is preferred.

   initialization vector (IV) selection for use with AES-CBC and AES-CTR
   in the firmware encryption context.  An IV MUST NOTE be re-used when
   the same key is used.  For this application, the IVs are not random
   but rather based on the slot/sector-combination in flash memory.  The
   text below assumes that the block-size of AES is (much) smaller than
   sector size.  The typical sector-size of flash memory is in the order
   of KiB.  Hence, multiple AES blocks need to be decrypted until an
   entire sector is completed.

8.1.  AES-CBC

   In AES-CBC a single IV is used for encryption of firmware belonging
   to a single sector since individual AES blocks are chained toghether,
   as shown in Figure 11.  The numbering of sectors in a slot MUST start
   with zero (0) and MUST increase by one with every sector till the end
   of the slot is reached.  The IV follows this numbering.

   For example, let us assume the slot size of a specific flash
   controller on an IoT device is 64 KiB, the sector size 4096 bytes (4
   KiB) and AES-128-CBC uses an AES-block size of 128 bit (16 bytes).
   Hence, sector 0 needs 4096/16=256 AES-128-CBC operations using IV 0.
   If the firmware image fills the entire slot then that slot contains
   16 sectors, i.e. IVs ranging from 0 to 15.

                        Figure 11: AES-CBC Operation

8.2.  AES-CTR

   Unlike AES-CBC, AES-CTR uses an IV per AES operation, as shown in
   Figure 12.  Hence, when an image is encrypted using AES-CTR-128 or
   AES-CTR-256, the IV MUST start with zero (0) and MUST be incremented
   by one for each 16-byte plaintext block within the entire slot.

   Using the previous example with a slot size of 64 KiB, the sector
   size 4096 bytes and the AES plaintext block size of 16 byte requires
   IVs from 0 to 255 in the first sector and 16 * 256 IVs for the
   remaining sectors in the slot.

9.2.  AES Key Wrap Example with Fetch + Copy Directives

10.  Security Considerations

   The algorithms described in this document assume that the party
   performing payload encryption

   *  shares a key-encryption key (KEK) with the recipient (for use with
      the AES Key Wrap scheme), or

   *  is in possession of the public key of the recipient (for use with
      ECDH-ES).

   Both cases require some upfront communication interaction.  This
   interaction is likely provided by an IoT device management solution,
   as described in [RFC9019].

   For AES Key Wrap to provide high security it is important that the
   KEK is of high entropy, and that implementations protect the KEK from
   disclosure.  Compromise of the KEK may result in the disclosure of
   all key data protected with that KEK.

Internet-Draft    Encrypted Payloads in SUIT Manifests        April 2023


   Since the CEK is randomly generated, it must be ensured that the
   guidelines for random number generation in [RFC8937] are followed.

   In some cases third party companies analyse binaries for known
   security vulnerabilities.  With encrypted payloads this type of
   analysis is prevented.  Consequently, these third party companies
   either need to be given access to the plaintext binary before
   encryption or they need to become authorized recipients of the
   encrypted payloads.  In either case, it is necessary to explicitly
   consider those third parties in the software supply chain when such a
